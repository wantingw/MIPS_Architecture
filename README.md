# MIPS Architecture

This repository works with MIPS assembly language and uses QtSpim help debug the programs. Each program will walk into the MIPS assembly language step by step.



## Program 1: C/F and Km/Miles Conversions

The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with SPIM MIPS System Calls, conditional operations, and integer instructions(mul, div, add...). A SPIM MIPS system call list is attached in Appendix A, feel free to make the reference to it. 

This program will convert Celsius to Fahrenheit (Km to Miles) and vice versa. We set input 0 for C to F and 1 for F to C.
